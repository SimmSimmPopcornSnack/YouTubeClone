Implementation based on a tutorial https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-youtube-with-react/
1. Install Postgresql to the local drive with an installer    
2. Move to this project folder  
3. Install Prisma to the folder https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation  
4. Form the tutorial, create "schema.prisma" on the project root. The tutorial says "prisma.schema" but it is not correct.
5. Install Prisma client via "npm install @prisma/client". It creates a database by reading the schema file.
6. Install Express framework: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
7. Try a hello-world example https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html. Rename app.helloworld.js to app.js and run it on Node.js from VSCode. Open "localhost:3000" from a browser, then you will see "Hello world".
